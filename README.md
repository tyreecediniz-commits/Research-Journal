#Research Journal
This is my first github repository! :)
At this point, github is still new to me but I am learning as I go.

##What is going on here?
This repo consists of my notes, as I refresh come basic mathematics and key concepts and learn extracurricular topics too. 
Alongside my univeristy studies, I am studying quantum information via IBM's online course, while also learning how to use their SDK, Qiskit, to run quantum-information based code on python.
My interests very often splits into different areas of maths and physics, and so the journal is generally meant to help track these interests and the things I learn! However, the overall aim is building the understanding of quantum systems and physics required to delve into deeper areas of the field, specifically QFT and simialr areas.
