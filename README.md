#Research Journal
This is my first repository :) At this point, I don't know much about github but i'm learning

##What is going on in this repository?
It consists of my research/learning notes and files for my research journal.
I am currently studying quantum information via IBM's online course, while also learning use of their SDK, Qiskit, for running quantum information based code. 
The aim in this is to build the understanding of quantum systems needed to begin looking into QFT and similar areas. 
Essentially, while initially broad, the aim in the research journal is primarily to build pre-required knowledge for learning the depths of quantum physics.
